# hello-world
My first attempt at creating a repository
Hi, I am AEDevrez.
I'm interested in object oriented programming. As of currently I'm learning Python, also I'm intending to learn C/C++ and Java. I'm a begginer level learner and am looking for basic projects which could teach me more about programming and enhance my coding skills.
